# Iceman Media

Iceman Media is my personal photography website, but it's not only an introductory site. In the hopefully near future, when the website will be finished it will offer a gallery for the ones who want to see my hobby and work, but also it will be a showroom for people who want to be my customer and wish to receive a full website for their own or company with self made professional photography and unique design.

## Features

Typography and Color scheme

I wanted to go simple yet stylish on the design.
The whole website uses only one font (cursive) and the color scheme is basically tan (#E4DCD1) and black (#000000).
Has a black brick background and a hint of (aqua) resembling "ice" to spice up some parts (see "send it" button).
