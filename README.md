# Iceman Media

Iceman Media is my personal photography website, but it's not only an introductory site. In the hopefully near future, when the website will be finished it will offer a gallery for the ones who want to see my hobby and work, but also it will be a showroom for people who want to be my customer and wish to receive a full website for their own or company with self made professional photography and unique design.

## Features

-_Typography and Color scheme_

I wanted to go simple yet stylish on the design.
The whole website uses only one font (cursive) and the color scheme is basically tan (#E4DCD1) and black (#000000).
Has a black brick background and a hint of (aqua) resembling "ice" to spice up some parts (see "send it" button).

### Existing features

* Includes 5 links total. 
* The name is directs to the top of the first page from any other page.

-_The introduction section_
* The "About me" section contains a short introduction, hence the title.
* It also has 2 link to 2 separate Instagram profiles as my main reaching point for all media. Basically Instagram centers most of my media, therefore I code this section to center the links.
* Both links styled as a button, and works like a normal link would. Also opens in a new tab. Although the links are not blue, nor will turn purple after visit.
